# Introduction to R for the R-curious aRchaeologist
This is a Github repository to hold information relative to the 2-hour seminar entitled: "Using R Statistical Computing Language for Archaeological".  This introductory seminar is being hosted by the [Society for American Archaeology][SAA] on September 27th at 2 to 4pm (EDT).  SAA members can sign up through [SAA Seminars] page.  Beacuse this is a professional development seminar that is eligible for Continuing Education Credits from the [Register for Profesional Archaeologists][RPA] it is a fee-based seminar.  The materials presented in this repo are intended to help participants of this seminar gain familiarity with R and data analaysis, but others are free to use and learn a bit about R and its use in archaeology.  While the slides from the seminar and audio/video are property of the SAA and not available here, I think there should be lots of material here to help anyone get started.

Given that the seminar is not in person, only two hours in length, and geared towards giving a broad introduction to the capabilities and potential of using R in arhcaeology, it is not given as a hands-on demo.  However, with the material presented here, attendees may download the data and code to follow along during the seminar or repeat the analysis afterwords.  Contact me at the addresses below and I will be happy to help get you started before the seminar or walk-though the material afterwards.

**This Readme will be updated with new links and info until September 27th**

#### About me
My name is Matthew Harris, I am an archaeologist and GIS professional with 16 years of professional experience conducting archaeological excavations, planning GIS studies, digital field data collection, statistical analysis, model building, and more so these days project management and associated tasks. While I have worked at in University and State agency roles, most of my carreer thus far is in the private sector field of Cultrual Resources Management.  I currently work for [AECOM] in their Burlington, New Jersey office.

I can be found at:
  * [@Md_Harris] - On Twitter talking about models, data viz, and archaeology
  * [My blog] - Occasional postings about the same stuff, but with code and lots of tangents

# What's in here?
This repro is inteded to hold information and code relevant to the SAA seminar, as well as help anyone who stumbles on here looking for introductory material for R. The basic content includes

  - Details on the seminar content
  - Data sets that will be used in the seminar
  - R code that will be used in the seminar
  - Link to software resources, classes, videos, and websites with good introductory material for learnign R
 
# What to expect from the Seminar?
The goal of this 2-hour online seminar is to introduce archaeologists to the benefits of using the statistical coding language R in various levels of field work and analysis.  R is a very powerful free, open-source, and extensible coding language that has gained tremendous popularity in many scientific and humanities fields.  This seminar will focus on introducing the capabilities of R, a brief run through the language syntax and conventions, provide an over view of the available packages, and review a number of real world applications.  This seminar is intended for at least three different audiences:  1) students looking to get some insight into new techniques to help their research; 2) professionals who are new to coding, but want to see what it has to offer their work; and 3) those with some coding experience who want to see the benefits of a new language or new examples in a language in which they are familiar.

The semiar objectives are for participants to learn about the.
1) benefits of using computer code to achieve more efficient, repeatable, and open archaeological analysis; 
2) basics of how to install R and get working on their own data; and 
3) the depth of analysis they can pursue as illustrated through real world examples.
